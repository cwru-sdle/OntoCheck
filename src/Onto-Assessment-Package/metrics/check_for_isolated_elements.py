def check_for_isolated_elements(ttl_file: str):
    """
    C1 - Number of isolated elements
    
    Analyze an OWL ontology in Turtle format to identify isolated atomic classes and isolated properties.

    Definitions
    -----------
    - Atomic classes are named classes (with URI) that are NOT constructed classes
      (i.e., they do not have owl:unionOf, owl:intersectionOf, or owl:complementOf).

    - A class (atomic or constructed with URI) is considered connected if it:
        * participates in rdfs:subClassOf, owl:equivalentClass, or owl:disjointWith relations 
          involving atomic classes, OR
        * is used as domain or range of properties and contains at least one atomic class
          inside its construction.

    - A property is considered connected if it is related by any of:
      rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:inverseOf, owl:propertyDisjointWith, or owl:equivalentProperty.

    Author: Van Tran
    Version: 0.1

    Parameters
    ----------
    ttl_file : str
        File path to the ontology Turtle (.ttl) file.

    Prints
    ------
    Lists of isolated atomic classes and isolated properties.

    Notes
    -----
    - Only named classes explicitly declared as owl:Class are considered.
    - Only properties explicitly declared as owl:ObjectProperty or owl:DatatypeProperty are considered.
    - Relations checked for classes include rdfs:subClassOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:disjointWith,
      and usage as domain or range of properties.
    - Relations checked for properties include rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:inverseOf, owl:propertyDisjointWith,
      and owl:equivalentProperty.
